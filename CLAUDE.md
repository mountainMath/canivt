# CLAUDE.md — canivt

Guidance for working on **canivt**, an R package that downloads and parses
StatCan *Beyond 20/20* `.ivt` tables into tidy data / Parquet / CSV, and extracts
their metadata (dimension members, geographic identifiers/DGUIDs, footnotes).

This folder is self-contained. The authoritative file-format reference is
[`inst/notes/ivt-format.md`](inst/notes/ivt-format.md) — **read it before changing
the parser.** A user-facing version is the vignette `vignettes/ivt-format.Rmd`.

## What works today

Fully decodes and validates the **2021-era Beyond 20/20 layout** (reference table
98-10-0241): all 166 geographies, 7,489,464 cells, exact vs the StatCan CSV;
plus all dimension labels, geography DGUIDs, and footnotes. Whole-file pure-R
decode runs in ~4–5 s.

Older layouts (e.g. 1991 census) are **not** supported; `read_ivt()` rejects
unrecognised files via `ivt_is_supported()`.

## Code map (`R/`)

| file | role |
|------|------|
| `utils-bytes.R` | low-level readers: `rd_u16/rd_u32/rd_int_run/rd_pascal`; latin-1 decode. **All offsets are 0-based** (binary layout); helpers convert to R's 1-based indexing. |
| `container.R`   | geography index + page directory; constants `IVT_IDX0=37167`, `IVT_IDX_STRIDE=0x1000`, `IVT_PAGES_PER_GEO=288`; page header/value-start logic. |
| `decode.R`      | presence-bitmap + dense value decode → cell tibble (vectorised per page; `IVT_GRID` precomputed group order). |
| `codebook.R`    | header identity, dimension member blocks, geography names + DGUIDs, footnotes. |
| `read.R`        | public `read_ivt()`, `ivt_metadata()`, `ivt_tidy()`, `print.ivt`; `ivt_is_supported()` format gate. |
| `download.R`    | `ivt_download()` from the b2020 endpoint; `ivt_pid8()`. |
| `write.R`       | `ivt_write_parquet()/_csv()/_metadata()`; `ivt_label_depth()`. |
| `canivt-package.R` | `ivt_read_table()` one-shot wrapper + package doc. |

## Key invariants (don't regress)

- Index stride is **`0x1000`**, giving **166** geographies in metadata member
  order (directory `n` → Member ID `n+1`). Striding by `0x8000` silently reads
  only every 8th geography — the original bug.
- Presence bytes are pair-swapped (`bitwXor(housing, 1)`); the value stream is
  **not** swapped. Tenure `t` uses bit `7 - t`.
- Member id columns in `cells` are **1-based** (match StatCan Member IDs); the
  `Coordinate` field in the CSV ground truth is also 1-based.

## Dev workflow

```r
devtools::load_all(".")
devtools::document()          # after changing roxygen comments
devtools::test()             # unit tests always run; decode tests need a sample
devtools::check()
```

Integration tests in `tests/testthat/test-decode.R` need a real `.ivt`; point
`CANIVT_SAMPLE_IVT` at a copy of `98100241.ivt`, e.g.

```sh
CANIVT_SAMPLE_IVT=/path/to/98100241.ivt Rscript -e 'devtools::test()'
```

They auto-skip if no sample is found (they also fall back to
`~/projects/censusmapper-import/data/raw/98100241/98100241.ivt` if present — the
sibling reverse-engineering repo where the format was originally cracked).

`.ivt` and large `.csv` files are git-ignored; never commit them.

## Likely next tasks

- Add a format detector + decoder for the **1991** layout (see the bottom of
  `inst/notes/ivt-format.md` for what differs).
- Footnote *text* extraction is robust (maximal text-byte runs; all 10 EN + 10
  FR recovered, exact vs the metadata). Remaining nicety: attribute each footnote
  to the dimension/member it annotates (by codebook proximity or note ids).
- Optional: expose the per-dimension `depth` directly on `ivt_tidy()` output.
- Consider an `Rcpp` fast path only if pure-R decode becomes a bottleneck (it is
  fine at ~5 s for the reference table).

## Provenance

The IVT format was reverse-engineered in a separate repo
(`~/projects/censusmapper-import`, Python reference decoders `python/ivt2021.py`
and `python/ivt2021_codebook.py`). `canivt` is the standalone R port; it does not
depend on that repo at runtime.
